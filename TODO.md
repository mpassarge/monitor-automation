* [ ] Over USB possible, otherwise need 1 male to n female splitter. Or USB 1 to n splitter
* [ ] Architect the API
    * [ ] Create the Data Model for a Profile
        * [ ] Way to order monitors (1,2,3 isn't necessarilly in that order all the time)?
        * [ ] Way to identify specific monitors?
