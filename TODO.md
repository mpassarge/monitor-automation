Creating a Python Flask Web Service for controlling different "Profiles" of a given Monitor set up:

* [x] Set up machine for Python Development
* [x] Create Initial Flask app with single hello world endpoint
* [x] Create POC for running bash command from a given endpoint call
* [ ] Architect the API
    * [ ] Create the Data Model for a Profile
        * [ ] Way to order monitors (1,2,3 isn't necessarilly in that order all the time)?
        * [ ] Way to identify specific monitors?
    * [ ] Configuration file on host vs ability to CRUD Profiles through API
    * [ ] Create the POST endpoint for creating a Profile
    * [ ] Create the GET endpoint for retrieving information on all the Profiles
    * [ ] Create the GET endpoint for retrieving information of a given Profile
    * [ ] Create the POST endpoint for setting a given Profile
    * [ ] Create the GET endpoint for retrieving the given Profile currently set
* [ ] Create frontend GUI **(OPTIONAL)** vs. MACRO Button...?
